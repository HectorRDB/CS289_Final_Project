Here you will put any data files to be re-loaded


-------------------------------------------

synthetic_data.csv:

Generated by the script simulation.py
Contains the synthetic dataset on which our methods will be tested. Contains the noisy and dropped values of randomly generated functions.


-------------------------------------------

times.csv

Generated by the script simulation.py
Contains the timestamps of the points stored in synthetic data.
In synthetic_data.csv the point at the column i has the timestamp i.


-------------------------------------------

dropped_points.csv

Generated by the script simulation.py
Contains the classes of the points in synthetic_data.csv.
A dropped point (or FALSE zero) has the class 0 .
A non dropped point (a TRUE zero or a non zero value) has the class 1.


-------------------------------------------

generative_functions.csv

Generated by the script simulation.py
Contains the coefficients of the randomly generated polynomials used to generate synthetic_data.csv.
This file may be used as the gold standard to assess to quality of a model.
