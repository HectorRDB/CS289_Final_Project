> These are materials for the final project for CS289

_**Group members:**_ Daniel Amar, Ariane Lozac'hmeur, Hector Roux de BÃ©zieux & Alexandre Vincent

The data is too large to be stored on Github but it is available at https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzdJ4so0WQKENHo2ZWxPeWYxdXM.

The repository contains the following things:

- An Code/ folder for different scripts (such as loading and cleaning the data)
- A figure folder for interesting plots
- A cache folder containing working environements.
- A sandbox containing R script (or other) for preliminary data analysis
- A todo.md doc which acts as a todo list.

Other folders and documents will be added in time.

Your local repositories should also contain a data folder that will be ignored when pushing your commits.
