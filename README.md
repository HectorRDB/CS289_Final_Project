# Stat245D Final Project

This is the Github repository with Maxwell Murphy, Yajing Li and Hector Roux de BÃ©zieux for the final project of Sandrine's Dudoit Stat 245D final project.

The data is too large to be stored on Github but it is available at https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzdJ4so0WQKENHo2ZWxPeWYxdXM.

The repository contains the following things:

- An R/ folder for different scripts (such as loading and cleaning the data)
- A specific folder for each dataset for individual work, named as their GSE number.
- A figure folder for interesting plots
- A cache folder containing working .Rdata environements.
- A sandbox containing R script (or other) for preliminary data analysis
- A todo.md doc which acts as a todo list.
- A paper folder for interesting/relevant papers.

Other folders and documents will be added in time.
