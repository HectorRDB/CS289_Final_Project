The data is too large to be stored on Github but it is available at upon request.

The repository contains the following things:

- An Code/ folder for different scripts (such as loading and cleaning the data)
- A figure folder for interesting plots
- A cache folder containing working environements.
- A sandbox containing R script (or other) for preliminary data analysis
- A todo.md doc which acts as a todo list.

Your local repositories should also contain a data folder that will be ignored when pushing your commits.
